# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Typocalypse

Welcome to the very first chapter of our journey: building **Typocalypse**, a minimalist, yet powerful text editor in C. In this chapter, weâ€™ll set up our Linux development environment, compile our first stub program, and lay down the theoretical foundation that will power all the raw-mode terminal magic to come.

## Why "Typocalypse"?

The name **Typocalypse** is a playful mash-up of **"type"** and **"apocalypse"**â€”evoking the idea of unleashing a storm of characters with every keystroke! As a text editor, Typocalypse aims to give you direct, low-level control over terminal input and output, so you can sculpt your text world precisely as you see fit.

## What Does a Text Editor Actually Do?

Before diving into implementation details, itâ€™s helpful to break down the core responsibilities of a text editorâ€”especially one running in a terminal:

1. **Display Buffer Management**

   * Maintain an in-memory array (or similar structure) of lines and characters.
   * Efficiently insert, delete, and modify text without redrawing the entire screen every time.

2. **User Input Handling**

   * Read keypress events one at a time (hence raw mode).
   * Distinguish printable characters, control keys (arrows, Home/End), and command shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl-S to save).

3. **Cursor Movement and Screen Refresh**

   * Track the cursorâ€™s logical position within the buffer.
   * Map that to a physical position on the screen, handling line wrapping and scrolling.
   * Refresh only the parts of the screen that changed, minimizing flicker.

4. **File I/O**

   * Load existing text files into the buffer at startup.
   * Write the buffer back to disk on save, handling errors gracefully (e.g., disk full).

5. **Editing Commands and Modes**

   * Provide basic commands: insert text, delete text, cut/copy/paste.
   * Optionally support modes (e.g., insert vs. command mode) or shortcuts for power users.

6. **Syntax and Search (Advanced)**

   * Highlight syntax based on file type.
   * Search within the buffer, supporting regular expressions or incremental search.

### How to Think Like an Editor-Builder

* **Start Small**: Focus on displaying static text and moving the cursor around.
* **Iterate Quickly**: Build one feature at a timeâ€”raw-mode input, then cursor movement, then text insertion.
* **Data Structures Matter**: Choose a buffer representation that makes common operations (like insertion) efficient.
* **Optimize Only When Necessary**: Begin with a simple array-of-strings, and refactor to a gap buffer or rope if performance demands it.
* **Embrace Terminal Controls**: Learn ANSI escape codes for cursor movement, color, and screen clearing. These are your painting tools.

With this mental model in place, youâ€™ll know exactly where to focus in each chapter. Now, letâ€™s see our highâ€‘level plan for ChapterÂ 1!

## Todayâ€™s Roadmap

1. **Theory Spotlight**: Understand how terminals process input and why we need "raw mode."
2. **Environment Setup**: Verify and install `gcc`/`cc` and `make` on Linux.
3. **Hello, Typocalypse**: Write `typocalypse.c` with a minimal `main()` stub.
4. **Automate with Make**: Create a Makefile to compile into an executable named `main`.
5. **Test Drive**: Compile, run, and inspect the exit code to confirm success.

By the end of this chapter, our build system will be humming, and youâ€™ll have the theoretical insight needed to tackle raw-mode terminal I/O in ChapterÂ 2.

## 1. Theory Spotlight: Terminals, Canonical vs. Raw Mode

Most shells operate in **canonical mode**, where your input is buffered and lineâ€‘editedâ€”press Backspace to erase, and only when you hit Enter does the program see your text. But a text editor needs to respond instantly to each keypress: arrow keys, Ctrl-K, even Ctrl-C must be handled in real time.

To break free from the shellâ€™s line discipline, we switch the terminal into **raw mode**. In raw mode:

* **No buffering**: Input appears character-by-character.
* **No echo**: Keystrokes arenâ€™t automatically printed.
* **No special handling**: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z, and others send their raw byte codes to your program instead of triggering signals.

Weâ€™ll achieve this by tweaking the terminal flags defined in `<termios.h>`:

* **ECHO**: whether typed characters are shown.
* **ICANON**: whether input is buffered until newline.
* **ISIG**: whether special characters generate signals.
* **IXON**: whether Ctrl-S/Ctrl-Q (XON/XOFF) flow control is enabled.

**Analogy**: Think of canonical mode as a polite teaâ€‘party host who waits until everyoneâ€™s finished speaking (Enter) before summarizing (delivering input). Raw mode is more like a live podcastâ€”every whisper, cough, and click goes straight to the mics.

---

## 2. Environment Setup

Our code will use `<termios.h>`, which isnâ€™t available on Windows. Hereâ€™s how you prepare on Linux:

1. **Install the C Compiler and Make**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install gcc make
   ```

   This installs the GNU Compiler Collection (`gcc`) and the `make` utility.

2. **Verify the installation**

   ```bash
   cc --version    # should print the compiler version
   make -v         # should print the make version
   ```

   If you see version information, youâ€™re all set!

---

## 3. Writing the First Source File

1. Create `typocalypse.c`:

   ```bash
   touch typocalypse.c
   ```
2. Open `typocalypse.c` and add:

   ```c
   int main() {
       return 0;
   }
   ```

> **Why ************\`\`************?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*?**
> Execution in C begins at `main()`. Returning `0` tells the OS everything went smoothly.

---

## 4. Creating the Makefile

Forget typing the compile command by handâ€”let Make do it.

Create a file named `Makefile` and add (use a real **tab** before the compile line):

```makefile
# Makefile for Typocalypse

main: typocalypse.c
	$(CC) typocalypse.c -o main -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99
```

* \`\` defaults to `cc`.
* \`\` enable helpful warnings.
* \`\` locks the C99 standard.
* \`\` is our output executable, replacing the source name.

---

## 5. Compiling and Running

1. **Build**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   * If nothing has changed, youâ€™ll see `make: 'main' is up to date.`
   * If you edited `typocalypse.c`, Make rebuilds `main`.

2. **Run**

   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

   No output yetâ€”this is expected.

3. **Check the exit status**

   ```bash
   echo $?
   ```

   You should see `0`, confirming your program returned success.

> **Pro tip:** Change `return 0;` to `return 5;`, re-run `make`, `./main`, and `echo $?`. Youâ€™ll observe the exit code `5` show up!

## Looking Ahead

Armed with environment setup and terminal theory, youâ€™re ready to plunge into **ChapterÂ 2**. Weâ€™ll:

* Switch the terminal into **raw mode** using `<termios.h>`.
* Read individual keystrokes without waiting for Enter.
* Start painting characters and controlling cursor movement.

Brace yourself: the keyboard is about to become your paintbrush! ðŸŽ¨
